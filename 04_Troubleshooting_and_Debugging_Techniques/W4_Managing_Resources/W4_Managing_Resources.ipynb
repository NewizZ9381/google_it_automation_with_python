    "Memory leak : happens when a chunk of memory that's no longer needed is not released\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing programs in languages like C, or C plus plus, the programmer is in charge of deciding how much memory to request, and when to give it back.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the program uses all of the available memory, then no processes will be able to request more memory, and things will start failing in weird ways. When this happens, the OS might terminate processes to free up some of the memory, causing unrelated programs to crash. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python, Java, or Go manage memory for us\n",
    "To understand how this works, let's look into what these languages do. First, they request the necessary memory when we create variables, and then they run a tool called Garbage collector, that's in charge of freeing the memory that's no longer in use. To detect when that's the case, the garbage collector looks at the variables in use and the memory assigned to them and then checks if there any portions of the memory that aren't being referenced by any variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, even when the language takes care of requesting and releasing the memory for us, we could still see the same effects of a memory leak.\n",
    " \n",
    "So memory leaks are less of an issue for programs that are short lived, but can become especially problematic for processes that keep running in the background.\n",
