    "There are a couple of different ways that we can scale our service in the Cloud, horizontally and vertically. To scale a deployment horizontally, we add more nodes into the pool that's part of a specific service.\n",
    "If you're scaling a deployment vertically, it means you're making your nodes bigger. When we say bigger here we're talking about the resources assigned to the nodes like memories, CPU, and disk space.\n",

    "Depending on our deployment and our needs, we might need to scale both horizontally and vertically to scale the capacity of our service.\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about scaling in the Cloud, another aspect we need to take into account is whether the scaling is done automatically or manually.\n",
