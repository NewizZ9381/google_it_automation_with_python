This principle is also known as treating your computers as cattle instead of pets because you care for them as a group rather than individually.\n",

    "One valuable benefit of this process is that the configuration applied to the device doesn't depend on a human remembering to follow all the necessary steps.\n",

    "To sum all of this up, managing your Infrastructure as Code it means that your fleet of nodes are \n",

    "2) versioned, \n",
    "3) reliable, \n",
    "4) and repeatable.\n",
    "\n",

If the information we need to make a decision isn't available through one of these facts, we can also write a script that checks for the information and turns it into our own custom fact."
