    "Capacity : is how much the service can deliver.\n",
    "This capacity change is called scaling. \n",
    "In particular, we call it upscaling when we increase our capacity and downscaling when we decrease it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of different ways that we can scale our service in the Cloud, horizontally and vertically. To scale a deployment horizontally, we add more nodes into the pool that's part of a specific service.\n",
    "If you're scaling a deployment vertically, it means you're making your nodes bigger. When we say bigger here we're talking about the resources assigned to the nodes like memories, CPU, and disk space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on our deployment and our needs, we might need to scale both horizontally and vertically to scale the capacity of our service.\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about scaling in the Cloud, another aspect we need to take into account is whether the scaling is done automatically or manually.\n",
    "Automatic scaling, we're using a service offered by the Cloud provider. This service uses metrics to automatically increase or decrease the capacity of the system.\n",
    "But make sure you set a reasonable quotas for your autoscaling systems.\n",
    "Manual scaling means that changes are controlled by humans instead of software\n"

    "\n",
    "We'll still depend on the vendor for other aspects of the deployment, like the network configuration or the services availability. If something does break, you might need to get support from the vendor to fix the problem. So when choosing a cloud provider, it's important to know what kind of support is available and select the one that fits your needs.\n",

    "1) multi-factor authentication, \n",

    "2) Private Clouds :  When your company owns the services and the rest of your infrastructure, whether that's on-site or in a remote data center\n",
    "3) Hybrid Clouds : A mixture of both public and private Clouds. The trick to making the most of the hybrid Cloud is ensuring that everything is integrated smoothly.\n",
    "4) Multi-Clouds : A mixture of public and/or private Clouds across vendors. Using multi-Clouds can be expensive, but it gives you extra protection. If one of your providers has a problem, your service can keep running on the infrastructure provided by a different provider"
